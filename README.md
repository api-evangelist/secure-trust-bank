> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's

> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is

> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within

>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Secure Trust Bank PLC is an award-winning UK specialist bank, founded in 1952 in the West Midlands and headquartered in Solihull, providing savings accounts and specialist lending to over a million retail and business customers. It is a publicly listed company (London Stock Exchange: STB) rather than a mutual or building society, authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA (FRN 204550).

As a UK ASPSP under PSD2 and the CMA Open Banking framework, its regulated account products sit against the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) standards. Secure Trust Bank is a specialist lender and **not** one of the nine CMA9-mandated banks; at review time it publishes **no public developer portal or bank-branded Open Banking developer host**. The API surfaces below therefore reference the shared OBIE standard specifications the bank's products conform to, not proprietary Secure Trust Bank API contracts.
